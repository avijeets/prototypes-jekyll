#### Hey! My name is Avijeet Sachdev, but you can call me Avi. 

I love tinkering with technology to turn impossibile ideas into tangible products, especially ones that can empower people. I am a Software Engineer in New York City, currently working as an iOS Engineer at Healthfirst.

Furthermore, I have a deep appreciation for art that pushes the needle forward, speaks volumes subtly, and exudes creativity. I've spent countless hours exploring the diverse works of UI/UX design, music production, street photography, and fashion. A selected few artists that hold great influence on me are [A Tribe Called Quest](http://atribecalledquest.com/), [Madlib](https://www.stonesthrow.com/madlib), [Matt Stuart](http://www.mattstuart.com/photography), and [Ronnie Fieg](https://shop.ronniefieg.com/blogs/news). I am known to collect vinyl records and sneakers.

### Previously

Throughout my experiences working for companies such as Avanade/Accenture, Viacom, Bond, to.be, Betaworks, and DoSomething, I have built functionality for projects including a dynamic advertisement configuration tool, clothing marketplace for user-submitted designs, and an interactive data-driven dashboard.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Informatics, with an emphasis in Human-Computer Interaction, with minors in Computer Science and Philosophy from [Rutgers University](http://rutgers.edu) in New Brunswick, NJ. My course work included Principles of Programming Languages, Data Structures and Algorithms, Web Design, Human-Computer Interaction, Philosophical Logic, Database Management Systems, and Computer Architecture. I served as President of the [Rutgers Mobile App Development Club](https://rumad.club/), coordinating workshops and mentor programs for students interested in applying Computer Science theory to iOS and Android platforms.

### Philosophy

* Dream in years
* Plan in months
* Evaluate in weeks
* Ship daily

<hr>

* Prototype for 1x
* Build for 10x
* Engineer for 100x

<hr> 

* What's required to cut the timeline in half?
* What needs to be done to double the impact?
