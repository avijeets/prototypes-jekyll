title: FocusLoop - Productivity tracking with watchOS

For a while, I have thought about how great and straightforward Apple Watch's Activity loops are with displaying your daily physical activity. Imagine there was a similar diagram for your productivity levels.

For optimal productivity, I like to set hourly goals ensuring I have something to consistently deliver to keep me on track. FocusLoop lets users set notification routines (triggered every X hours) asking if you are indeed staying productive. If the user prompts yes, the dialog box disappears. If the user prompts no, it brings you to a table of common distractions to let you log what kept you from your goals.

The paired iOS application then shows (and persists, shout out Core Data) you the log of what held you from your hourly deliverables.
