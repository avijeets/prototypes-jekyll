# Prototypes

Prototypes is a project I created to display and describe every piece of technology I've tinkered with. I have spent the past few years learning about and trying my hand at the full-stack, mobile, and IoT platforms. Some of the projects I built never made it to production, but still were functional and solved the problem they set out to fix.
